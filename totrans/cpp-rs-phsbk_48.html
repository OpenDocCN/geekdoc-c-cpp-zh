<h1>Pointer-to-implementation (PIMPL)</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/pimpl.html">PIMPL pattern</a> in
C++ is usually used for the purpose of improving compilation times by removing
implementation details from the ABI of a translation unit. It also can be used
to hide implementation details that otherwise would be exposed in a header file.</p>
<p>In Rust, the unit of separate compilation is the crate, rather than the file or
module. Within a crate, the compiler minimizes compilation times via incremental
compilation, rather than via separate compilation. Between crates, there is no
guarantee of Rust-native ABI stability, so if an upstream crate changes,
downstream crates need to be recompiled. Thus, for performance purposes, the
PIMPL pattern does not apply.</p>
<p>For the hiding of implementation details, <a href="../idioms/encapsulation.html">instead of excluding details from a
header file, modules can be used to control
visibility</a>.</p>
