  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For MySQL secondary replay, this defines balanced replay speed where the MySQL
    secondary matches the primary under normal circumstances. When the speed is at
    or below the balanced replay speed, there is no significant lag in transaction
    replay progress on the secondary. However, if the speed exceeds this threshold,
    the secondary begins to lag behind the primary in transaction replay progress.
