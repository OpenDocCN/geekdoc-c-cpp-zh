- en: This book is designed to help C++ programmers learn Rust. It provides translations
    of common C++ patterns into idiomatic Rust. Each pattern is described through
    concrete code examples along with high-level discussion of engineering trade-offs.

    When you are writing Rust code and think, "I know how to do this in C++ but not
    Rust," then look for the corresponding chapter in this book.

    and [Learn Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/),
    this book is less about "Rust behind the scenes" and more about explicitly describing
    how Rust works in terms of C++.
