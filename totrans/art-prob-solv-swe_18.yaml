- en: Programming demands strong logical reasoning skills, crucial for problem-solving,
    algorithm design, debugging, code comprehension, performance optimization, and
    testing. It helps in analyzing problems, creating solutions, correcting errors,
    and ensuring software reliability. Developing logical reasoning is essential for
    programmers to think systematically and build efficient, reliable software [56].

- en: MySQL development often focuses primarily on simple tests using testing tools,
    which can miss opportunities to discover many problems. Testing MySQL itself is
    a monumental task, and relying solely on testing tools is insufficient to expose
    all problems. Optimization differs across projects and environments, and using
    real online traffic makes it more targeted and effective. Thus, MySQL optimization
    based on live traffic is highly valuable.

- en: MySQL performance optimization heavily relies on mitigating scalability problems.
    Enhanced versions of MySQL have addressed most scalability problems, establishing
    a solid foundation for further optimizations. Profile-guided optimization (PGO)
    is crucial for MySQL, and as scalability problems improve, its importance will
    continue to grow. Utilizing better memory allocation tools can significantly improve
    the performance of both the MySQL primary and secondary replay.

    will be the future trend. Our extensive experience in the long-term transformation
    of Group Replication has laid a solid foundation for achieving true high availability.
    The speed of MySQL secondary replay determines the quality of MySQL’s high availability.
    Achieving replay speeds in the range of millions of tpmC is possible but requires
    persistent effort.
