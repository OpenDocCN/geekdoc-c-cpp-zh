- en: This book contains a step-by-step walkthrough of a simple implementation of
    a Redis-like server. It is intended as a practical guide or tutorial to network
    programming and the implementation and application of basic data structures in
    C.

- en: Redis could be considered one of the *building blocks* of modern computing that
    stood the test of time. The knowledge required for building such a project is
    broader and deeper than usual application-level development. Learning from such
    projects is a good way for software developers to level up their skills.

    of software engineering: network programming and data structures.'

- en: While there are many guides on socket APIs or high-level libraries, network
    programming is more than calling APIs or libraries. It is important to understand
    core concepts such as the event loop, protocols, timers, etc, which this book
    will cover. The lack of understanding can result in fatal mistakes even if you
    are just employing high-level networking libraries or frameworks in your applications.

- en: Although many people learned some basic data structures from textbooks, there
    is still something more to learn. Data structures implemented in real projects
    often have some practical considerations which are not touched by textbooks. Learning
    how data structures are used in a non-toy environment (especially in C) is a unique
    experience from building Redis.

    effort, which can be hard to grasp for beginners. Instead, this book takes an
    opposite approach: learning by building things *from scratch*.'

    gradually. Starting from the small, adding things incrementally, and getting the

    stuff works, the understanding obtained by reading those materials is often not
    the same as building the stuff yourself. It is easy to mistake memorization for
    understanding, and it’s easier to pick up unimportant details than principles
    and basics.'

    aspect of the subject — there are no shortcuts to knowledge! And often not every
    aspect is known to you beforehand, you may discover “things I don’t know I don’t
    know” in the process.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book follows a step-by-step approach. Each step builds on the previous
    one, adding a new concept. The full source code is provided on the web for reference
    purposes, readers are advised to tinker with it or DIY without it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The code is written as direct and straightforwardly as the author could. It’s
    mostly plain C with minimal C++ features. Don’t worry if you don’t know C, you
    just have the opportunity to do it in another language by yourself.

    LoC seems low, but it illustrates many important aspects the book attempts to
    cover.

- en: The techniques and approaches used in the book are not exactly the same as the
    real Redis. Some are intentionally simplified, and some are chosen to illustrate
    a general topic. Readers can learn even more by comparing different approaches.
