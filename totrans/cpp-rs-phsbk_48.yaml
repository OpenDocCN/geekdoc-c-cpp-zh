- en: The [PIMPL pattern](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/pimpl.html) in
    C++ is usually used for the purpose of improving compilation times by removing
    implementation details from the ABI of a translation unit. It also can be used
    to hide implementation details that otherwise would be exposed in a header file.

- en: In Rust, the unit of separate compilation is the crate, rather than the file
    or module. Within a crate, the compiler minimizes compilation times via incremental
    compilation, rather than via separate compilation. Between crates, there is no
    guarantee of Rust-native ABI stability, so if an upstream crate changes, downstream
    crates need to be recompiled. Thus, for performance purposes, the PIMPL pattern
    does not apply.

    a header file, modules can be used to control visibility](../idioms/encapsulation.html).
