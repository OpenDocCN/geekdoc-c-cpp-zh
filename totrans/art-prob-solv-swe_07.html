<p>To effectively address MySQL’s myriad problems, a solid foundation in computer science is indispensable. MySQL not only encapsulates a wealth of computer science principles but also presents learners with diverse challenges, offering valuable practical experience. This chapter centers on essential computer science fundamentals necessary for solving MySQL problems. The emphasis is on applying this foundational knowledge in practical scenarios, rather than theoretical teaching.</p>
