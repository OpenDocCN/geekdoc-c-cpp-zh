- en: One major difference between the C++ and Rust ecosystems is that C++ and C libraries
    tend to be either provided by OS distributions or be included in the repository
    for a project, while Rust has a central language-specific package registry called
    [crates.io](https://crates.io/).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This difference is amplified by the fact that the Rust build tool, Cargo, has
    a build in package manager that works with crates.io, private registries, local
    packages, and vendored sources.

- en: Many C libraries have crates on crates.io providing both low-level bindings
    and high-level safe Rust abstractions. For example, for the libgit2 library there
    is both a low-level [libgit2-sys crate](https://crates.io/crates/libgit2-sys)
    and a high-level [git2 crate](https://crates.io/crates/git2). See the [chapter
    on the Rust FFI](../idioms/ffi.html) for more information on how to define these
    crates.

    can be used to build C and C++ code as part of a Rust project. The linked chapter
    of the Cargo book includes links to resources handling the compilation of C, C++,
    and other code, working with `pkg-config`, etc.

- en: Unlike CPack which is provided with CMake, Cargo does not come with tools for
    packaging for distribution to end users. However, there are third party Cargo
    helpers for packaging, such as [cargo-deb](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-deb)
    for creating Debian package, [cargo-generate-rpm](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-generate-rpm)
    for creating RPM packages, and [cargo-wix](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-wix)
    for creating Windows installers.
