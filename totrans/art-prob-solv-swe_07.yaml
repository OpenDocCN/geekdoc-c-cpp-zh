- en: To effectively address MySQL’s myriad problems, a solid foundation in computer
    science is indispensable. MySQL not only encapsulates a wealth of computer science
    principles but also presents learners with diverse challenges, offering valuable
    practical experience. This chapter centers on essential computer science fundamentals
    necessary for solving MySQL problems. The emphasis is on applying this foundational
    knowledge in practical scenarios, rather than theoretical teaching.
