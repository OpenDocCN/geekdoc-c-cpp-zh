      would need to know the most intimate details of the underlying
      hardware to get anything to run.  Worse still, their programs
      would not run on other hardware, even if that hardware has only

      systems job to allow this to happen seamlessly.</p><p class="releaseinfo">The operating system is responsible for <em class="calibre5">resource
      management</em> within the system.  Many tasks will be
      competing for the resources of the system as it runs, including
      processor time, memory, disk and user input.  The job of the
      operating system is to arbitrate these resources to the multiple
      tasks and allow them access in an orderly fashion.  You have
      probably experienced when this <em class="calibre5">fails</em> as it
      usually ends up with your computer crashing (the famous "blue

      many different hardware platforms as possible.  By having
      operating system support for standardised interfaces,
      programmers can get this functionality.</p><p class="releaseinfo">For example, if the function to open a file on one system
      is <code class="computeroutput1">open()</code>, on another is
      <code class="computeroutput1">open_file()</code> and on yet another
      <code class="computeroutput1">openf()</code> programmers will have
      the dual problem of having to remember what each system does and
      their programs will not work on multiple systems.</p><p class="releaseinfo">The Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)<span id="role_of_operating_system_s3_para3_footnote1-fnote"><div class="author"><p class="calibre26">The X comes from <em class="calibre5">Unix</em>, from which
	  the standard grew.  Today, POSIX is the same thing as the
	  Single UNIX Specification Version 3 or ISO/IEC
	  9945:2002. This is a free standard, available online.</p><p class="calibre26">Once upon a time, the Single UNIX specification and
	  the POSIX Standards were separate entities. The Single UNIX
	  specification was released by a consortium called the "Open
	  Group", and was freely available as per their
	  requirements. The latest version is The Single Unix
	  Specification Version 3.</p><p class="calibre26">The IEEE POSIX standards were released as IEEE Std
	  1003.[insert various years, revisions here], and were not
	  freely available. The latest version is IEEE 1003.1-2001 and
	  is equivalent to the Single Unix Specification Version 3.</p><p class="calibre26">Thus finally the two separate standards were merged
 into what is known as the Single UNIX Specification Version 3, which
 is also standardised by the ISO under ISO/IEC 9945:2002. This
 happened early in 2002.  So when people talk about POSIX, SUS3 or
 ISO/IEC 9945:2002 they all mean the same thing!</p></div></span> is

As the
      arbitrator of access to the system the operating system is
      responsible for ensuring that only those with the correct

      often security issues will be found.  Often a virus or worm will
      take advantage of these bugs to access resources it should not

      overall system performance.</p><p class="releaseinfo">The operating system needs to exploit the features of the
      underlying hardware to make sure it is getting the best possible
      performance for the operations, and consequently systems
      programmers need to understand the intimate details of the
      architecture they are building for.</p><p class="releaseinfo">In many cases the systems programmers job is about
      deciding on policies for the system.  Often the case that the
      side effects of making one part of the operating system run
      faster will make another part run slower or less efficiently.
      Systems programmers need to understand all these trade offs when
      they are building their operating system.</p></section></section></div></main>

      As the figure illustrates, the kernel communicates to hardware
      both directly and through <em class="calibre5">drivers</em>.</p><p class="releaseinfo">Just as the kernel abstracts the hardware to user
      programs, drivers abstract hardware to the kernel.  For example
      there are many different types of graphic card, each one with
      slightly different features.  As long as the kernel exports an
      API, people who have access to the specifications for the
      hardware can write drivers to implement that API.  This way the
      kernel can access many different types of hardware.</p><p class="releaseinfo">The kernel is generally what we called
      <em class="calibre5">privileged</em>.  As you will learn, the
      hardware has important roles to play in running multiple tasks
      and keeping the system secure, but these rules do not apply to
      the kernel.  We know that the kernel must handle programs that
      crash (remember it is the operating system's job arbitrate
      between multiple programs running on the same system, and there
      is no guarantee that they will behave), but if any internal part
      of the operating system crashes, chances are the entire system
      will become useless.  Similarly security issues can be exploited
      by user processes to escalate themselves to the privilege level
      of the kernel; at that point they can access any part of the
      system completely unchecked.</p><section id="organisation_of_os_s1_s1"><header class="calibre8"><h4 class="calibre21"><span class="first-last">2<span class="first-last">.</span>1<span class="first-last">.</span>1<span class="first-last"> </span></span>Monolithic v Microkernels</h4></header><p class="releaseinfo">One debate that is often comes up surrounding operating
	systems is whether the kernel should be a
	<em class="calibre5">microkernel</em> or
	<em class="calibre5">monolithic</em>.</p><p class="releaseinfo">The monolithic approach is the most common, as taken by
	most common Unixes (such as Linux).  In this model the core
	privileged kernel is large, containing hardware drivers,
	file system accesses controls, permissions checking and
	services such as Network File System (NFS).</p><p class="releaseinfo">Since the kernel is always privileged, if any part of it
	crashes the whole system has the potential to come to a halt.
	If one driver has a bug, it can overwrite any memory in the
	system with no problems, ultimately causing the system to
	crash.</p><p class="releaseinfo">A microkernel architecture tries to minimise this
	possibility by making the privileged part of the kernel as
	small as possible.  This means that most of the system runs as
	unprivileged programs, limiting the harm that any one crashing
	component can influence.  For example, drivers for hardware
	can run in separate processes, so if one goes astray it can
	not overwrite any memory but that allocated to it.</p><p class="releaseinfo">Whilst this sounds like the most obvious idea, the
	problem comes back two main issues</p><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="calibre11"><p class="releaseinfo">Performance is decreased.  Talking between many
	    different components can decrease performance.</p></li><li class="calibre11"><p class="releaseinfo">It is slightly more difficult for the
	    programmer.</p></li></ol><p class="releaseinfo">Both of these criticisms come because to keep separation
	between components most microkernels are implemented with a
	<em class="calibre5">message passing</em> based system, commonly
	referred to as <em class="calibre5">inter-process
	communication</em> or IPC.  Communicating between
	individual components happens via discrete messages which must
	be bundled up, sent to the other component, unbundled,
	operated upon, re-bundled up and sent back, and then unbundled
	again to get the result.</p><p class="releaseinfo">This is a lot of steps for what might be a fairly simple
	request from a foreign component.  Obviously one request might
	make the other component do more requests of even more
	components, and the problem can multiply.  Slow message
	passing implementations were largely responsible for the poor
	performance of early microkernel systems, and the concepts of
	passing messages are slightly harder for programmers to program
	for.  The enhanced protection from having components run
	separately was not sufficient to overcome these hurdles in
	early microkernel systems, so they fell out of fashion.</p><p class="releaseinfo">In a monolithic kernel, calls between components are
	simple function calls, as all programmers are familiar
	with.</p><p class="releaseinfo">There is no definitive answer as to which is the best
	organisation, and it has started many arguments in both
	academic and non-academic circles.  Hopefully as you learn
	more about operating systems you will be able to make up your
	own mind!</p><section id="organisation_of_os_s1_s1_s1"><header class="calibre8"><h5 class="calibre24"><span class="first-last">2<span class="first-last">.</span>1<span class="first-last">.</span>1<span class="first-last">.</span>1<span class="first-last"> </span></span>Modules</h5></header><p class="releaseinfo">The Linux kernel implements a module system, where
	  drivers can be loaded into the running kernel "on the fly" as
	  they are required.  This is good in that drivers, which make
	  up a large part of operating system code, are not loaded for
	  devices that are not present in the system.  Someone who
	  wants to make the most generic kernel possible (i.e. runs on
	  lots of different hardware, such as RedHat or Debian) can
	  include most drivers as modules which are only loaded if the
	  system it is running on has the hardware available.</p><p class="releaseinfo">However, the modules are loaded directly in the
	  privileged kernel and operate at the same privilege level as
	  the rest of the kernel, so the system is still considered a
	  monolithic kernel.</p></section></section><section id="organisation_of_os_s1_s2"><header class="calibre8"><h4 class="calibre21"><span class="first-last">2<span class="first-last">.</span>1<span class="first-last">.</span>2<span class="first-last"> </span></span>Virtualisation</h4></header><p class="releaseinfo">Closely related to kernel is the concept of
	virtualisation of hardware.  Modern computers are very
	powerful, and often it is useful to not think of them as one
	whole system but split a single physical computer up into
	separate "virtual" machines.  Each of these virtual machines
	looks for all intents and purposes as a completely separate
	machine, although physically they are all in the same box, in
	the same place.</p><div id="organisation_of_os_s1_s2_fig1" class="figure"><div class="author"><div class="media"><picture><img src="virtual.svg" class="calibre12"/></picture></div><div class="caption"><p class="calibre20">Some different virtualisation methods.</p></div></div><header class="calibre8"><div class="title"><span>Figure<span> </span></span><span>2<span>.</span>1<span>.</span>2<span>.</span>1<span> </span></span>The Operating System</div></header></div><p class="releaseinfo">This can be organised in many different ways.  In the
	simplest case, a small <em class="calibre5">virtual machine monitor
	</em> can run directly on the hardware and provide an
	interface to the guest operating systems running on top.  This
	VMM is often often called a hypervisor (from the word
	"supervisor")<span id="organisation_of_os_s1_s2_para2_footnote1-fnote">In fact, the hypervisor shares
	much in common with a micro-kernel; both strive to be small
	layers to present the hardware in a safe fashion to layers
	above it.</span>.  In fact, the operating system on
	top may have no idea that the hypervisor is even there at all,
	as the hypervisor presents what appears to be a complete
	system.  It intercepts operations between the guest operating
	system and hardware and only presents a subset of the system
	resources to each.</p><p class="releaseinfo">This is often used on large machines (with many CPUs and
	much RAM) to implement <em class="calibre5">partitioning</em>.
	This means the machine can be split up into smaller virtual
	machines.  Often you can allocate more resources to running
	systems on the fly, as requirements dictate.  The hypervisors
	on many large IBM machines are actually quite complicated
	affairs, with many millions of lines of code.  It provides a
	multitude of system management services.</p><p class="releaseinfo">Another option is to have the operating system be aware
        of the underlying hypervisor, and request system resources
        through it.  This is sometimes referred to as
        <em class="calibre5">paravirtualisation</em> due to its halfway
        nature.  This is similar to the way early versions of the Xen
        system work and is a compromise solution.  It hopefully
        provides better performance since the operating system is
        explicitly asking for system resources from the hypervisor
        when required, rather than the hypervisor having to work
        things out dynamically.</p><p class="releaseinfo">Finally, you may have a situation where an application
	running on top of the existing operating system presents a
	virtualised system (including CPU, memory, BIOS, disk, etc)
	which a plain operating system can run on.  The application
	converts the requests to hardware through to the underlying
	hardware via the existing operating system.  This is similar
	to how VMWare works.  This approach has many overheads, as the
	application process has to emulate an entire system and
	convert everything to requests from the underlying operating
	system.  However, this lets you emulate an entirely different
	architecture all together, as you can dynamically translate
	the instructions from one processor type to another (as the
	Rosetta system does with Apple software which moved from the
	PowerPC processor to Intel based processors).</p><p class="releaseinfo">Performance is major concern when using any of these
	virtualisation techniques, as what were once fast operations
	directly on hardware need to make their way through layers of
	abstraction.</p><p class="releaseinfo">Intel have discussed hardware support for virtualisation
	soon to be coming in their latest processors.  These
	extensions work by raising a special exception for operations
	that might require the intervention of a virtual machine
	monitor.  Thus the processor looks the same as a
	non-virtualised processor to the application running on it,
	but when that application makes requests for resources that
	might be shared between other guest operating systems, the
	virtual machine monitor can be invoked.</p><p class="releaseinfo">This provides superior performance because the virtual
	machine monitor does not need to monitor every operation to
	see if it is safe, but can wait until the processor notifies
	that something <em class="calibre5">unsafe</em> has
	happened.</p><section id="organisation_of_os_s1_s2_s1"><header class="calibre8"><h5 class="calibre24"><span class="first-last">2<span class="first-last">.</span>1<span class="first-last">.</span>2<span class="first-last">.</span>1<span class="first-last"> </span></span>Covert Channels</h5></header><p class="releaseinfo">This is a digression, but an interesting security flaw
	  relating to virtualised machines.  If the partitioning of
	  the system is not static, but rather
	  <em class="calibre5">dynamic</em>, there is a potential security
	  issue involved.</p><p class="releaseinfo">In a dynamic system, resources are allocated to the
	  operating systems running on top as required.  Thus if one
	  is doing particularly CPU intensive operations whilst the
	  other is waiting on data to come from disks, more of the CPU
	  power will be given to the first task.  In a static system,
	  each would get 50% an the unused portion would go to
	  waste.</p><p class="releaseinfo">Dynamic allocation actually opens up a communications
	  channel between the two operating systems.  Anywhere that
	  two states can be indicated is sufficient to communicate in
	  binary.  Imagine both systems are extremely secure, and no
	  information should be able to pass between one and the
	  other, ever.  Two people with access could collude to pass
	  information between themselves by writing two programs that
	  try to take large amounts of resources at the same
	  time.</p><p class="releaseinfo">When one takes a large amount of memory there is less
	  available for the other.  If both keep track of the maximum
	  allocations, a bit of information can be transferred.  Say
	  they make a pact to check every second if they can allocate
	  this large amount of memory.  If the target can, that is
	  considered binary 0, and if it can not (the other machine
	  has all the memory), that is considered binary 1.  A data
	  rate of one bit per second is not astounding, but
	  information is flowing.</p><p class="releaseinfo">This is called a <em class="calibre5">covert channel</em>,
	  and whilst admittedly far-fetched there have been examples
	  of security breaches from such mechanisms.  It just goes to
	  show that the life of a systems programmer is never simple!</p></section></section></section><section id="organisation_of_os_s2"><header class="calibre8"><h3 class="calibre2"><span class="first-last">2<span class="first-last">.</span>2<span class="first-last"> </span></span>Userspace</h3></header><p class="releaseinfo">We call the theoretical place where programs are run by

      some way to communicate to the kernel we wish to make a system
      call.  All architectures define an instruction, usually called
      <code class="computeroutput1">break</code> or something similar,
      that signals to the hardware we wish to make a system
      call.</p><p class="releaseinfo">Specifically, this instruction will tell the hardware to
      modify the instruction pointer to point to the kernels system
      call handler (when the operating system sets its self up it
      tells the hardware where its system call handler lives).  So
      once the userspace calls the break instruction, it has lost
      control of the program and passed it over to the kernel.</p><p class="releaseinfo">The rest of the operation is fairly straight forward.
        The kernel looks in the predefined register for the system
        call number, and looks it up in a table to see which function
        it should call.  This function is called, does what it needs
        to do, and places its return value into
        <em class="calibre5">another</em> register defined by the ABI as
        the return register.</p><p class="releaseinfo">The final step is for the kernel to make a jump
        instruction back to the userspace program, so it can continue
        off where it left from.  The userpsace program gets the data
        it needs from the return register, and continues happily on
        its way!</p><p class="releaseinfo">Although the details of the process can get quite hairy,

      to illustrate the mechanism behind system calls.  The first
      thing to note is that there is a
      <code class="computeroutput1">syscall</code> argument provided by
      the system libraries for directly making system calls.  This
      provides an easy way for programmers to directly make systems
      calls without having to know the exact assembly language
      routines for making the call on their hardware.  So why do we
      use <code class="computeroutput1">getpid()</code> at all?  Firstly,
      it is much clearer to use a symbolic function name in your code.
      However, more importantly,
      <code class="computeroutput1">getpid()</code> may work in very
      different ways on different systems.  For example, on Linux the
      <code class="computeroutput1">getpid()</code> call can be cached, so
      if it is run twice the system library will not take the penalty
      of having to make an entire system call to find out the same
      information again.</p><p class="releaseinfo">By convention under Linux, system calls numbers are
      defined in the <code class="computeroutput1">asm/unistd.h</code>
      file from the kernel source.  Being in the
      <code class="computeroutput1">asm</code> subdirectory, this is
      different for each architecture Linux runs on.  Again by
      convention, system calls numbers are given a
      <code class="computeroutput1">#define</code> name consisting of
      <code class="computeroutput1">__NR_</code>.  Thus you can see our
      code will be making the <code class="computeroutput1">getpid</code>
      system call, storing the value in
      <code class="computeroutput1">pid</code>.</p><p class="releaseinfo">We will have a look at how several architectures implement
      this code under the hood.  We're going to look at real code, so
      things can get quite hairy.  But stick with it -- this is
      <em class="calibre5">exactly</em> how your system works!</p><section id="system_calls_s2_s1"><header class="calibre8"><h4 class="calibre21"><span class="first-last">3<span class="first-last">.</span>2<span class="first-last">.</span>1<span class="first-last"> </span></span>PowerPC</h4></header><p class="releaseinfo">PowerPC is a RISC architecture common in older Apple

</pre></div><header class="calibre8"><div class="title"><span>Example<span> </span></span><span>3<span>.</span>2<span>.</span>1<span>.</span>1<span> </span></span>PowerPC system call example</div></header></div><p class="releaseinfo">This code snippet from the kernel header file
	<code class="computeroutput1">asm/unistd.h</code> shows how we can
	implement system calls on PowerPC.  It looks very complicated,
	but it can be broken down step by step.</p><p class="releaseinfo">Firstly, jump to the end of the example where the
	<code class="computeroutput1">_syscallN</code> macros are defined.
	You can see there are many macros, each one taking
	progressively one more argument.  We'll concentrate on the
	most simple version,
	<code class="computeroutput1">_syscall0</code> to start with.  It
	only takes two arguments, the return type of the system call
	(e.g. a C <code class="computeroutput1">int</code> or
	<code class="computeroutput1">char</code>, etc) and the name of
	the system call.  For <code class="computeroutput1">getpid</code>
	this would be done as
	<code class="computeroutput1">_syscall0(int,getpid)</code>.</p><p class="releaseinfo">Easy so far!  We now have to start pulling apart
	<code class="computeroutput1">__syscall_nr</code> macro.  This is
	not dissimilar to where we were before, we take the number of
	arguments as the first parameter, the type, name and then the
	actual arguments.</p><p class="releaseinfo">The first step is declaring some names for registers.
	What this essentially does is says
	<code class="computeroutput1">__sc_0</code> refers to
	<code class="computeroutput1">r0</code> (i.e. register 0).  The
	compiler will usually use registers how it wants, so it is
	important we give it constraints so that it doesn't decide to
	go using register we need in some ad-hoc manner.</p><p class="releaseinfo">We then call
	<code class="computeroutput1">sc_loadargs</code> with the
	interesting <code class="computeroutput1">##</code> parameter.
	That is just a <em class="calibre5">paste</em> command, which gets
	replaced by the <code class="computeroutput1">nr</code> variable.
	Thus for our example it expands to
	<code class="computeroutput1">__sc_loadargs_0(name, args);</code>.
	<code class="computeroutput1">__sc_loadargs</code> we can see
	below sets <code class="computeroutput1">__sc_0</code> to be the
	system call number; notice the paste operator again with the
	<code class="computeroutput1">__NR_</code> prefix we talked about,
	and the variable name that refers to a specific
	register.</p><p class="releaseinfo">So, all this tricky looking code actually does is puts
	the system call number in register 0!  Following the code
	through, we can see that the other macros will place the
	system call arguments into <code class="computeroutput1">r3</code>
	through <code class="computeroutput1">r7</code> (you can only have
	a maximum of 5 arguments to your system call).</p><p class="releaseinfo">Now we are ready to tackle the
	<code class="computeroutput1">__asm__</code> section.  What we
	have here is called <em class="calibre5">inline assembly</em>
	because it is assembler code mixed right in with source code.
	The exact syntax is a little to complicated to go into right
	here, but we can point out the important parts.</p><p class="releaseinfo">Just ignore the
	<code class="computeroutput1">__volatile__</code> bit for now; it
	is telling the compiler that this code is unpredictable so it
	shouldn't try and be clever with it.  Again we'll start at the
	end and work backwards.  All the stuff after the colons is a
	way of communicating to the compiler about what the inline
	assembly is doing to the CPU registers.  The compiler needs to
	know so that it doesn't try using any of these registers in
	ways that might cause a crash.</p><p class="releaseinfo">But the interesting part is the two assembly statements
	in the first argument.  The one that does all the work is the
	<code class="computeroutput1">sc</code> call.  That's all you need
	to do to make your system call!</p><p class="releaseinfo">So what happens when this call is made?  Well, the
	processor is interrupted knows to transfer control to a
	specific piece of code setup at system boot time to handle
	interrupts.  There are many interrupts; system calls are just
	one.  This code will then look in register 0 to find the
	system call number; it then looks up a table and finds the
	right function to jump to to handle that system call.  This
	function receives its arguments in registers 3 - 7.</p><p class="releaseinfo">So, what happens once the system call handler runs and
	completes?  Control returns to the next instruction after the
	<code class="computeroutput1">sc</code>, in this case a
	<em class="calibre5">memory fence</em> instruction.  What this
	essentially says is "make sure everything is committed to
	memory"; remember how we talked about pipelines in the
	superscalar architecture?  This instruction ensures that
	everything we think has been written to memory actually has
	been, and isn't making its way through a pipeline
	somewhere.</p><p class="releaseinfo">Well, we're almost done!  The only thing left is to
	return the value from the system call.  We see that
	<code class="computeroutput1">__sc_ret</code> is set from r3 and
	<code class="computeroutput1">__sc_err</code> is set from r0.
	This is interesting; what are these two values all
	about?</p><p class="releaseinfo">One is the return value, and one is the error value.
	Why do we need two variables?  System calls can fail, just as
	any other function.  The problem is that a system call can
	return any possible value; we can not say "a negative value
	indicates failure" since a negative value might be perfectly
	acceptable for some particular system call.</p><p class="releaseinfo">So our system call function, before returning, ensures
	its result is in register r3 and any error code is in register
	r0.  We check the error code to see if the top bit is set;
	this would indicate a negative number.  If so, we set the
	global <code class="computeroutput1">errno</code> value to it
	(this is the standard variable for getting error information
	on call failure) and set the return to be
	<code class="computeroutput1">-1</code>.  Of course, if a valid
	result is received we return it directly.</p><p class="releaseinfo">So our calling function should check the return value is
	not <code class="computeroutput1">-1</code>; if it is it can check
	errno to find the exact reason why the call failed.</p><p class="releaseinfo">And that is an entire system call on a PowerPC!</p></section><section id="system_calls_s2_s2"><header class="calibre8"><h4 class="calibre21"><span class="first-last">3<span class="first-last">.</span>2<span class="first-last">.</span>2<span class="first-last"> </span></span>x86 system calls</h4></header><p class="releaseinfo">Below we have the same interface as implemented for the

	that we looked at previously.  The x86 is classed as a CISC
	processor as opposed to the RISC PowerPC, and has dramatically
	less registers.</p><p class="releaseinfo">Start by looking at the most simple
	<code class="computeroutput1">_syscall0</code> macro.  It simply
	calls the <code class="computeroutput1">int</code> instruction
	with a value of <code class="computeroutput1">0x80</code>.  This
	instruction makes the CPU raise interrupt 0x80, which will
	jump to code that handles system calls in the kernel.</p><p class="releaseinfo">We can start inspecting how to pass arguments with the
	longer macros.  Notice how the PowerPC implementation cascaded
	macros downwards, adding one argument per time.  This
	implementation has slightly more copied code, but is a little
	easier to follow.</p><p class="releaseinfo">x86 register names are based around letters, rather than
	the numerical based register names of PowerPC.  We can see
	from the zero argument macro that only the
	<code class="computeroutput1">A</code> register gets loaded; from
	this we can tell that the system call number is expected in
	the <code class="computeroutput1">EAX</code> register.  As we
	start loading registers in the other macros you can see the
	short names of the registers in the arguments to the
	<code class="computeroutput1">__asm__</code> call.</p><p class="releaseinfo">We see something a little more interesting in
	<code class="computeroutput1">__syscall6</code>, the macro taking
	6 arguments.  Notice the <code class="computeroutput1">push</code>
	and <code class="computeroutput1">pop</code> instructions?  These
	work with the stack on x86, "pushing" a value onto the top of
	the stack in memory, and popping the value from the stack back
	into memory.  Thus in the case of having six registers we need
	to store the value of the <code class="computeroutput1">ebp</code>
	register in memory, put our argument in in (the
	<code class="computeroutput1">mov</code> instruction), make our
	system call and then restore the original value into
	<code class="computeroutput1">ebp</code>.  Here you can see the
	disadvantage of not having enough registers; stores to memory
	are expensive so the more you can avoid them, the
	better.</p><p class="releaseinfo">Another thing you might notice there is nothing like the
	<em class="calibre5">memory fence</em> instruction we saw
	previously with the PowerPC.  This is because on x86 the
	effect of all instructions will be guaranteed to be visible
	when the complete.  This is easier for the compiler (and
	programmer) to program for, but offers less
	flexibility.</p><p class="releaseinfo">The only thing left to contrast is the return value.  On
	the PowerPC we had two registers with return values from the
	kernel, one with the value and one with an error code.
	However on x86 we only have one return value that is passed
	into <code class="computeroutput1">__syscall_return</code>.  That
	macro casts the return value to <code class="computeroutput1">unsigned
	long</code> and compares it to an (architecture and
	kernel dependent) range of negative values that might
	represent error codes (note that the
	<code class="computeroutput1">errno</code> value is positive, so
	the negative result from the kernel is negated).  However,
	this means that system calls can not return small negative
	values, since they are indistinguishable from error codes.
	Some system calls that have this requirement, such as
	<code class="computeroutput1">getpriority()</code>, add an offset
	to their return value to force it to always be positive; it is
	up to the userspace to realise this and subtract this constant
	value to get back to the "real" value.</p></section></section></section></div></main>

      system is to implement security; that is to not allow one
      application or user to interfere with any other that is running
      in the system.  This means applications should not be able to
      overwrite each others memory or files, and only access system
      resources as dictated by system policy.</p><p class="releaseinfo">However, when an application is running it has exclusive
      use of the processor.  We see how this works when we examine
      processes in the next chapter.  Ensuring the application only
      accesses memory it owns is implemented by the virtual memory
      system, which we examine in the chapter after next.  The
      essential point is that the hardware is responsible for
      enforcing these rules.</p><p class="releaseinfo">The system call interface we have examined is the
	gateway to the application getting to system resources.  By
	forcing the application to request resources through a system
	call into the kernel, the kernel can enforce rules about what
	sort of access can be provided.  For example, when an
	application makes an <code class="computeroutput1">open()</code>
	system call to open a file on disk, it will check the
	permissions of the user against the file permissions and
	allow or deny access.</p><section id="privileges_s1_s1"><header class="calibre8"><h4 class="calibre21"><span class="first-last">4<span class="first-last">.</span>1<span class="first-last">.</span>1<span class="first-last"> </span></span>Privilege Levels</h4></header><p class="releaseinfo">Hardware protection can usually be seen as a set of

	instructions; those that only the kernel should be allowed to
	call.  For example, the <code class="computeroutput1">HLT</code>
	instruction to halt the processor should not be allowed to be
	run by a user application, since it would stop the entire
	computer from working.  However, the kernel needs to be able
	to call this instruction when the computer is legitimately
	shut down.<span id="privileges_s1_s1_para2_footnote1-fnote">What happens when a "naughty"
	application calls that instruction anyway?  The hardware will
	usually raise an exception, which will involve jumping to a
	specified handler in the operating system similar to the
	system call handler.  The operating system will then probably
	terminate the program, usually giving the user some error
	about how the application has crashed.</span></p><p class="releaseinfo">Each inner ring can access any instructions protected by
	a further out ring, but not any protected by a further in ring.
	Not all architectures have multiple levels of rings as above,
	but most will either provide for at least a "kernel" and
	"user" level.</p><section id="x86_protection"><header class="calibre8"><h5 class="calibre24"><span class="first-last">4<span class="first-last">.</span>1<span class="first-last">.</span>1<span class="first-last">.</span>1<span class="first-last"> </span></span>386 protection model</h5></header><p class="releaseinfo">The 386 protection model has four rings, though most

	  application code running in the system have a small
	  descriptor, called a <em class="calibre5">code descriptor</em>,
	  which describes, amongst other things, its privilege level.
	  When running application code makes a jump into some other
	  code outside the region described by its code descriptor,
	  the privilege level of the target is checked.  If it is
	  higher than the currently running code, the jump is
	  disallowed by the hardware (and the application will crash).

	specific calls that allow it, such as the instruction to
	implement a system call.  These are usually referred to as a
	<em class="calibre5">call gate</em> because they function just as a
	physical gate; a small entry through an otherwise impenetrable
	wall.  When that instruction is called we have seen how the
	hardware completely stops the running application and hands
	control over to the kernel.  The kernel must act as a
	gatekeeper; ensuring that nothing nasty is coming through the
	gate.  This means it must check system call arguments
	carefully to make sure it will not be fooled into doing
	anything it shouldn't (if it can be, that is a security bug).
	As the kernel runs in the innermost ring, it has permissions
	to do any operation it wants; when it is finished it will
	return control back to the application which will again be
	running with its lower privilege level.</p></section><section id="fast_system_calls"><header class="calibre8"><h5 class="calibre24"><span class="first-last">4<span class="first-last">.</span>1<span class="first-last">.</span>1<span class="first-last">.</span>3<span class="first-last"> </span></span>Fast System Calls</h5></header><p class="releaseinfo">One problem with traps as described above is that they

          requires investigation of the ingenious but complicated
          segmentation scheme used by the processor.  The original
          reason for segmentation was to be able to use more than the

	    This means the processor needs to keep track of all these
	    different segments and their sizes, which it does using
	    <em class="calibre5">descriptors</em>.  The segment descriptors
	    available to everyone are kept in the <em class="calibre5">global

	    <a href="#x86_protection" class="xref pcalibre"><span><span>Section<span class="sep"> </span></span><span>4<span class="sep">.</span>1<span class="sep">.</span>1<span class="sep">.</span>1, </span><span>386 protection model</span></span></a>, x86 does this with
	    <em class="calibre5">rings</em>, where ring 0 is the highest
	    permission, ring 3 is the lowest, and inner rings can
	    access outer rings but not vice-versa.</p><p class="releaseinfo">As discussed in <a href="#raising_privilege" class="xref pcalibre"><span><span>Section<span class="sep"> </span></span><span>4<span class="sep">.</span>1<span class="sep">.</span>1<span class="sep">.</span>2, </span><span>Raising Privilege</span></span></a>, when ring 3 code
	    wants to jump into ring 0 code, it is essentially
	    modifying its code segment selector to point to a
	    different segment.  To do this, it must use a special
	    <em class="calibre5">far-call</em> instruction which hardware
	    ensures passes through the call gate.  There is no other
	    way for the running process to choose a new code-segment
	    descriptor, and hence the processor will start executing
	    code at the known offset within the ring 0 segment, which
	    is responsible for maintaining integrity (e.g. not reading
	    arbitrary and possibly malicious code and executing it.
	    Of course nefarious attackers will always look for ways to
	    make your code do what you did not intend it to!).</p><p class="releaseinfo">This allows a whole hierarchy of segments and
	    permissions between them.  You might have noticed a cross
	    segment call sounds exactly like a system call.  If you've
	    ever looked at Linux x86 assembly the standard way to make
	    a system call is <code class="computeroutput1">int
	    0x80</code>, which raises interrupt
	    <code class="computeroutput1">0x80</code>.  An interrupt stops
	    the processor and goes to an interrupt gate, which then
	    works the same as a call gate -- it changes privilege
	    level and bounces you off to some other area of code
	    .</p><p class="releaseinfo">The problem with this scheme is that it is
	    <em class="calibre5">slow</em>.  It takes a lot of effort to do
	    all this checking, and many registers need to be saved to
	    get into the new code.  And on the way back out, it all
	    needs to be restored again.</p><p class="releaseinfo">On a modern x86 system segmentation and the four-level
	    ring system is not used thanks to virtual memory,
	    discussed fully in <a href="csbu-print_split_028.html#chapter05" class="xref pcalibre"><span><span>Chapter<span class="sep"> </span></span><span>6, </span><span>Virtual Memory</span></span></a>.  The
	    only thing that really happens with segmentation switching
	    is system calls, which essentially switch from mode 3
	    (userspace) to mode 0 and jump to the system call handler
	    code inside the kernel.  Thus the processor provides extra
	    <em class="calibre5">fast system call</em> instructions called
	    <code class="computeroutput1">sysenter</code> (and
	    <code class="computeroutput1">sysexit</code> to get back)
	    which speed up the whole process over a
	    <code class="computeroutput1">int 0x80</code> call by removing
	    the general nature of a far-call — that is the
	    possibility of transitioning into any segment at any ring
	    level — and restricting the call to only transition
	    to ring 0 code at a specific segment and offset, as stored
	    in registers.</p><p class="releaseinfo">Because the general nature has been replaced with so
	    much prior-known information, the whole process can be
	    speed up, and hence we have a the aforementioned
	    <em class="calibre5">fast system call</em>.  The other thing to
	    note is that state is not preserved when the kernel gets
	    control.  The kernel has to be careful to not to destroy
	    state, but it also means it is free to only save as little
	    state as is required to do the job, so can be much more
	    efficient about it.  This is a very RISC philosophy, and
	    illustrates how the line blurs between RISC and CISC
	    processors.</p><p class="releaseinfo">For more information on how this is implemented in the
