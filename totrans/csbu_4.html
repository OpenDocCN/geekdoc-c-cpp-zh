      gets its memory in the following weeks -- it is one of the most
      fundamental parts of how the operating system works.  However,
      for now it is sufficient to know that each process gets its own
      section of memory.</p><p class="releaseinfo">In this memory all the program code is stored, along with
      variables and any other allocated storage.</p><p class="releaseinfo">Parts of the memory can be shared between processes
      (called, not surprisingly <em class="calibre5">shared memory</em>).
      You will often see this called <em class="calibre5">System Five Shared
      Memory</em> (or SysV SHM) after the original
      implementation in an older operating system.</p><p class="releaseinfo">Another important concept a process may utilise is that of
      <em class="calibre5">mmap</em>ing a file on disk to memory.  This
      means that instead of having to open the file and use commands
      such as <code class="computeroutput1">read()</code> and
      <code class="computeroutput1">write()</code> the file looks as if it
      were any other type of
      RAM. <code class="computeroutput1">mmaped</code> areas have
      permissions such as read, write and execute which need to be
      kept track of.  As we know, it is the job of the operating
      system to maintain security and stability, so it needs to check
      if a process tries to write to a read only area and return an
      error.</p><section id="elements_of_a_process_s2_s1"><header class="calibre8"><h4 class="calibre21"><span class="first-last">2<span class="first-last">.</span>2<span class="first-last">.</span>1<span class="first-last"> </span></span>Code and Data</h4></header><p class="releaseinfo">A process can be further divided into

	and data should be kept separately since they require
	different permissions from the operating system and separation
	facilitates sharing of code (as you see later).  The operating
	system needs to give program code permission to be read and

	memory called <em class="calibre5">the stack</em>.  This can be
	considered part of the data section of a process, and is
	intimately involved in the execution of any program.</p><p class="releaseinfo"> A stack is generic data structure that works exactly
	like a stack of plates; you can <em class="calibre5">push</em> an
	item (put a plate on top of a stack of plates), which then
	becomes the top item, or you can <em class="calibre5">pop</em> an
	item (take a plate off, exposing the previous plate).</p><p class="releaseinfo">Stacks are fundamental to function calls.  Each time a
	function is called it gets a new <code class="computeroutput1">stack
	frame</code>.  This is an area of memory which
	usually contains, at a minimum, the address to return to when
	complete, the input arguments to the function and space for
	local variables.</p><p class="releaseinfo">By convention, stacks usually <em class="calibre5">grow
	down</em><span id="elements_of_a_process_s2_s2_para4_footnote1-fnote">Some architectures, such as
	PA-RISC from HP, have stacks that grow upwards.  On some other
	architectures, such as IA64, there are other storage areas
	(the register backing store) that grow from the bottom toward
	the stack.</span> .  This means that the stack
	starts at a high address in memory and progressively gets
	lower.</p><div id="elements_of_a_process_s2_s2_fig1" class="figure"><div class="author" summary="How the stack works with function calls.

	features of functions.</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="calibre11"><p class="releaseinfo">Each function has its own copy of its input
	    arguments.  This is because each function is allocated a
	    new stack frame with its arguments in a fresh area of
	    memory.</p></li><li class="calibre11"><p class="releaseinfo">This is the reason why a variable defined inside a
	    function can not be seen by other functions.  Global
	    variables (which can be seen by any function) are
	    kept in a separate area of data memory.</p></li><li class="calibre11"><p class="releaseinfo">This facilitates <em class="calibre5">recursive</em>
	    calls.  This means a function is free to call itself
	    again, because a new stack frame will be created for all
	    its local variables.</p></li><li class="calibre11"><p class="releaseinfo">Each frame contains the address to return to.  C
	    only allows a single value to be returned from a function,
	    so by convention this value is returned to the calling
	    function in a specified register, rather than on the
	    stack.</p></li><li class="calibre11"><p class="releaseinfo">Because each frame has a reference to the one before
	    it, a debugger can "walk" backwards, following the
	    pointers up the stack.  From this it can produce a
	    <em class="calibre5">stack trace</em> which shows you all
	    functions that were called leading into this function.
	    This is extremely useful for debugging.</p><p class="releaseinfo">You can see how the way functions works fits exactly
	    into the nature of a stack.  Any function can call any
	    other function, which then becomes the up most function
	    (put on top of the stack).  Eventually that function will
	    return to the function that called it (takes itself off
	    the stack).</p></li><li class="calibre11"><p class="releaseinfo">Stacks do make calling functions slower, because
	    values must be moved out of registers and into memory.
	    Some architectures allow arguments to be passed in
	    registers directly; however to keep the semantics that
	    each function gets a unique copy of each argument the
	    registers must <em class="calibre5">rotate</em>.</p></li><li class="calibre11"><p class="releaseinfo">You may have heard of the term a <em class="calibre5">stack
	    overflow</em>.  This is a common way of hacking a
	    system by passing bogus values.  If you as a programmer
	    accept arbitrary input into a stack variable (say, reading
	    from the keyboard or over the network) you need to
	    explicitly say how big that data is going to be.</p><p class="releaseinfo">Allowing any amount of data unchecked will simply
	    overwrite memory.  Generally this leads to a crash, but
	    some people realised that if they overwrote just enough
	    memory to place a specific value in the return address
	    part of the stack frame, when the function completed
	    rather than returning to the correct place (where it was
	    called from) they could make it return into the data they
	    just sent.  If that data contains binary executable code
	    that hacks the system (e.g. starts a terminal for the user
	    with root privileges) then your computer has been
	    compromised.</p><p class="releaseinfo">This happens because the stack grows downwards, but
	    data is read in "upwards" (i.e. from lower address to
	    higher addresses).</p><p class="releaseinfo">There are several ways around this; firstly as a
	    programmer you must ensure that you always check the
	    amount of data you are receiving into a variable.  The
	    operating system can help to avoid this on behalf of the
	    programmer by ensuring that the stack is marked as
	    <em class="calibre5">not executable</em>; that is that the
	    processor will not run any code, even if a malicious user
	    tries to pass some into your program.  Modern
	    architectures and operating systems support this
	    functionality.</p></li><li class="calibre11"><p class="releaseinfo">Stacks are ultimately managed by the compiler, as it
	    is responsible for generating the program code.  To the
	    operating system the stack just looks like any other area
	    of memory for the process.</p></li></ul><p class="releaseinfo">To keep track of the current growth of the stack, the
	hardware defines a register as the <em class="calibre5">stack
	pointer</em>.  The compiler (or the programmer, when
	writing in assembler) uses this register to keep track of the
	current top of the stack.</p><div id="stack-pointer" class="figure"><div class="pre-wrap" db-startinglinenumber="1" db-numberoflines="25"><pre class="language-c"><span class="line" db-line="1"><span class="ln"> 1 <span class="nsep">|</span></span><span class="ld"><code class="calibre13">$ cat sp.c</code></span></span>

      may be able to read from a file but not write to it.  When the

      essentially performs generally simple operations on values in

      mentioned above that each process is allocated memory which the
      kernel keeps track of.</p><p class="releaseinfo">So the other side of the equation is keeping track of the
      registers.  When it comes time for the currently running process
      to give up the processor so another process can run, it needs to
      save its current state.  Equally, we need to be able to restore
      this state when the process is given more time to run on the
      CPU.  To do this the operating system needs to store a copy of
      the CPU registers to memory.  When it is time for the process to
      run again, the operating system will copy the register values
      back from memory to the CPU registers and the process will be
      right back where it left off.

      they hit the <code class="computeroutput1">fork()</code> system
      call. </p><p class="releaseinfo">At this point, the operating system will create a new
      process that is exactly the same as the parent process.  This
      means all the state that was talked about previously is copied,
      including open files, register state and all memory
      allocations, which includes the program code.</p><p class="releaseinfo">The return value from the system call is the only way the
      process can determine if it was the existing process or a new
      one.  The return value to the parent process will be the Process
      ID (PID) of the child, whilst the child will get a return value
      of 0.</p><p class="releaseinfo">At this point, we say the process has

	      They can only communicate with each other via other
	      system calls.</p><p class="releaseinfo">Threads however, share the same memory.  So you
	      have the advantage of multiple processes, with the
	      expense of having to use system calls to communicate
	      between them.</p><p class="releaseinfo">The problem that this raises is that threads can
	      very easily step on each others toes.  One thread might
	      increment a variable, and another may decrease it
	      without informing the first thread.  These type of
	      problems are called <em class="calibre5">concurrency
	      problems</em> and they are many and varied.</p><p class="releaseinfo">To help with this, there are userspace libraries
	      that help programmers work with threads properly.  The
	      most common one is called <code class="computeroutput1">POSIX
	      threads</code> or, as it more commonly
	      referred to
	      <code class="computeroutput1">pthreads</code></p></li><li class="calibre11"><p class="releaseinfo">Switching processes is quite expensive, and one of
	      the major expenses is keeping track of what memory each
	      process is using.  By sharing the memory this overhead
	      is avoided and performance can be significantly
	      increased.</p></li></ol><p class="releaseinfo">There are many different ways to implement threads.
	  On the one hand, a userspace implementation could implement
	  threads within a process without the kernel having any idea
	  about it.  The threads all look like they are running in a
	  single process to the kernel.</p><p class="releaseinfo">This is suboptimal mainly because the kernel is being
	  withheld information about what is running in the system.
	  It is the kernels job to make sure that the system resources
	  are utilised in the best way possible, and if what the kernel
	  thinks is a single process is actually running multiple
	  threads it may make suboptimal decisions.</p><p class="releaseinfo">Thus the other method is that the kernel has full
	  knowledge of the thread.  Under Linux, this is established
	  by making all processes able to share resources via the
	  <code class="computeroutput1">clone</code> system call.  Each
	  thread still has associated kernel resources, so the kernel
	  can take it into account when doing resource
	  allocations.</p><p class="releaseinfo">Other operating systems have a hybrid method, where some
	  threads can be specified to run in userspace only ("hidden"
	  from the kernel) and others might be a <em class="calibre5">light
	  weight process</em>, a similar indication to the
	  kernel that the processes is part of a thread group.</p></section><section id="linux_clone_s2"><header class="calibre8"><h5 class="calibre24"><span class="first-last">4<span class="first-last">.</span>3<span class="first-last">.</span>1<span class="first-last">.</span>2<span class="first-last"> </span></span>Copy on write</h5></header><p class="releaseinfo">As we mentioned, copying
	  the entire memory of one process to another when
	  <code class="computeroutput1">fork</code> is called is an
	  expensive operation.</p><p class="releaseinfo">One optimisation is called <em class="calibre5">copy on
	  write</em>.  This means that similar to threads above,
	  the memory is actually shared, rather than copied, between
	  the two processes when fork is called.  If the processes are
	  only going to be reading the memory, then actually
	  copying the data is unnecessary.</p><p class="releaseinfo">However, when a process writes to its memory, it
	  needs to be a private copy that is not shared.  As the name
	  suggests, copy on write optimises this by only doing the
	  actual copy of the memory at the point when it is written
	  to.</p><p class="releaseinfo">Copy on write also has a big advantage for
	  <code class="computeroutput1">exec</code>.  Since
	  <code class="computeroutput1">exec</code> will simply be
	  overwriting all the memory with the new program, actually
	  copying the memory would waste a lot of time.  Copy on write
	  saves us actually doing the copy.</p></section></section></section><section id="fork_and_exec_s4"><header class="calibre8"><h3 class="calibre2"><span class="first-last">4<span class="first-last">.</span>4<span class="first-last"> </span></span>The <span class="first-last">init</span> process</h3></header><p class="releaseinfo">We discussed the overall goal of the init process
      previously, and we are now in a position to understand how it
      works.</p><p class="releaseinfo">On boot the kernel starts the init process, which then
      forks and execs the systems boot scripts.  These fork and exec
      more programs, eventually ending up forking a login
      process.</p><p class="releaseinfo">The other job of the <code class="computeroutput1">init</code>
      process is "reaping".  When a process calls
      <code class="computeroutput1">exit</code> with a return code, the
      parent usually wants to check this code to see if the child
      exited correctly or not.</p><p class="releaseinfo">However, this exit code is part of the process which has
      just called <code class="computeroutput1">exit</code>.  So the
      process is "dead" (e.g. not running) but still needs to stay
      around until the return code is collected.  A process in this
      state is called a <em class="calibre5">zombie</em> (the traits of
      which you can contrast with a mystical zombie!)</p><p class="releaseinfo">A process stays as a zombie until the parent collects the
      return code with the <code class="computeroutput1">wait</code> call.
      However, if the parent exits before collecting this return code,
      the zombie process is still around, waiting aimlessly to give
      its status to someone.</p><p class="releaseinfo">In this case, the zombie child will be
      <em class="calibre5">reparented</em> to the init process which has a
      special handler that <em class="calibre5">reaps</em> the return
      value.  Thus the process is finally free and the descriptor can
      be removed from the kernels process table.</p><section id="fork_and_exec_s4_s1"><header class="calibre8"><h4 class="calibre21"><span class="first-last">4<span class="first-last">.</span>4<span class="first-last">.</span>1<span class="first-last"> </span></span>Zombie example</h4></header><div id="zombie-example" class="figure"><div class="pre-wrap" db-startinglinenumber="1" db-numberoflines="29"><pre class="language-c"><span class="line" db-line="1"><span class="ln"> 1 <span class="nsep">|</span></span><span class="ld"><code class="calibre13">$ cat zombie.c</code></span></span>

    PC you want to make sure that your graphical applications for your

      changes as new developers attempt to improve its
      behaviour.</p><p class="releaseinfo">The current scheduler is known as the O(1) scheduler,
which refers to the property that no matter how many processes the
scheduler has to choose from, it will choose the next one to run in a
constant amount of time<span id="scheduling_s4_para2_footnote1-fnote"><em class="calibre5">Big-O</em>
notation is a way of describing how long an algorithm takes to run
given increasing inputs.  If the algorithm takes twice as long to run
for twice as much input, this is increasing linearly.  If another
algorithm takes four times as long to run given twice as much input,
then it is increasing exponentially.  Finally if it takes the same
amount of time now matter how much input, then the algorithm runs in
constant time.  Intuitively you can see that the slower the algorithm
grows for more input, the better it is.  Computer science text books
deal with algorithm analysis in more detail.</span>.</p><p class="releaseinfo">Previous incarnations of the Linux scheduler used the
concept of <em class="calibre5">goodness</em> to determine which process to
run next.  All possible tasks are kept on a
<em class="calibre5">run queue</em>, which is simply a linked list of
processes which the kernel knows are in a "runnable" state (i.e. not
waiting on disk activity or otherwise asleep).  The problem arises
that to calculate the next process to run, every possible runnable
process must have its goodness calculated and the one with the highest
goodness ``wins''.  You can see that for more tasks, it will take
longer and longer to decide which processes will run next.</p><div id="scheduling_s4_fig1" class="figure"><div class="author" summary="A view of how the Linux scheduler manages processes."><div class="media"><picture><img src="o1queue.svg" alt="A view of how the Linux scheduler manages processes." class="calibre12"/></picture></div></div><header class="calibre8"><div class="title"><span>Figure<span> </span></span><span>6<span>.</span>4<span>.</span>1<span> </span></span>The O(1) scheduler</div></header></div><p class="releaseinfo">In contrast, the O(1) scheduler uses a run queue structure
as shown above.  The run queue has a number of
<em class="calibre5">buckets</em> in priority order and a bitmap that flags
which buckets have processes available.  Finding the next process to
run is a matter of reading the bitmap to find the first bucket with
processes, then picking the first process off that bucket's queue.
The scheduler keeps two such structures, an
<em class="calibre5">active</em> and <em class="calibre5">expired</em> array for
processes that are runnable and those which have utilised their entire
time slice respectively.  These can be swapped by simply modifying
pointers when all processes have had some CPU time.</p><p class="releaseinfo">The really interesting part, however, is how it is decided
where in the run queue a process should go.  Some of the things that
need to be taken into account are the nice level, processor affinity
(keeping processes tied to the processor they are running on, since
moving a process to another CPU in a SMP system can be an expensive
operation) and better support for identifying interactive programs
(applications such as a GUI which may spend much time sleeping,
waiting for user input, but when the user <em class="calibre5">does</em>
get around to interacting with it wants a fast response).</p></section></section></div></main>

    handling processes on your system.  Once the shell was the primary
    interface, however modern Linux systems have a GUI and provide a
    shell via a "terminal application" or similar.  The primary job of
    the shell is to help the user handle starting, stopping and
    otherwise controlling processes running in the system.</p><p class="releaseinfo">When you type a command at the prompt of the shell, it will
    <code class="computeroutput1">fork</code> a copy of itself and
    <code class="computeroutput1">exec</code> the command that you have
    specified.</p><p class="releaseinfo">The shell then, by default, waits for that process to finish
    running before returning to a prompt to start the whole process
    over again.</p><p class="releaseinfo">As an enhancement, the shell also allows you to
    <em class="calibre5">background</em> a job, usually by placing an
    <code class="computeroutput1">&amp;</code> after the command name.
    This is simply a signal that the shell should fork and execute the
    command, but <em class="calibre5">not</em> wait for the command to
    complete before showing you the prompt again.</p><p class="releaseinfo">The new process runs in the background, and the shell is
    ready waiting to start a new process should you desire.  You can
    usually tell the shell to <em class="calibre5">foreground</em> a
    process, which means we do actually want to wait for it to
    finish.</p><p class="releaseinfo">XXX : a bit of history about bourne shell</p></section></div></main>

<section id="signals"><header class="calibre8"><h2 class="calibre7" id="calibre_pb_33"><span class="first-last">8<span class="first-last"> </span></span>Signals</h2></header><p class="releaseinfo">Processes running in the system require a way to be told
    about events that influence them.  On UNIX there is
    infrastructure between the kernel and processes called
    <em class="calibre5">signals</em> which allows a process to receive
    notification about events important to it.</p><p class="releaseinfo">When a signal is sent to a process, the kernel invokes a
    <em class="calibre5">handler</em> which the process must register with
    the kernel to deal with that signal.  A handler is simply a
    designed function in the code that has been written to
    specifically deal with interrupt.  Often the signal will be sent
    from inside the kernel itself, however it is also common for one
    process to send a signal to another process (one form of
    <em class="calibre5">interprocess communication</em>).  The signal
    handler gets called <em class="calibre5">asynchronously</em>; that is
    the currently running program is interrupted from what it is doing
    to process the signal event.</p><p class="releaseinfo">For example, one type of signal is an
    <em class="calibre5">interrupt</em> (defined in system headers as
    <code class="computeroutput1">SIGINT</code>) is delivered to the
    process when the <code class="computeroutput1">ctrl-c</code>
    combination is pressed.</p><p class="releaseinfo">As a process uses the <code class="computeroutput1">read</code>
    system call to read input from the keyboard, the kernel will be
    watching the input stream looking for special characters.  Should
    it see a <code class="computeroutput1">ctrl-c</code> it will jump into
    signal handling mode.  The kernel will look to see if the process
    has registered a handler for this interrupt.  If it has, then
    execution will be passed to that function where the function will
    <em class="calibre5">handle</em> it.  Should the process have not
    registered a handler for this particular signal, then the kernel
    will take some default action.  With
    <code class="computeroutput1">ctrl-c</code> the default action is to
    terminate the process.</p><p class="releaseinfo">A process can choose to ignore some signals, but other
    signals are not allowed to be ignored.  For example,
    <code class="computeroutput1">SIGKILL</code> is the signal sent when a
    process should be terminated.  The kernel will see that the
    process has been sent this signal and terminate the process from
    running, no questions asked.  The process can not ask the kernel
    to ignore this signal, and the kernel is very careful about which
    process is allowed to send this signal to another process; you may
    only send it to processes owned by you unless you are the root
    user.  You may have seen the command <code class="computeroutput1">kill
    -9</code>; this comes from the implementation
    <code class="computeroutput1">SIGKILL</code> signal.  It is commonly
    known that <code class="computeroutput1">SIGKILL</code> is actually
    defined to be <code class="computeroutput1">0x9</code>, and so when
    specified as an argument to the
    <code class="computeroutput1">kill</code> program means that the
    process specified is going to be stopped immediately.  Since the
    process can not choose to ignore or handle this signal, it is seen
    as an avenue of last resort, since the program will have no chance
    to clean up or exit cleanly.  It is considered better to first
    send a <code class="computeroutput1">SIGTERM</code> (for terminate) to
    the process first, and if it has crashed or otherwise will not
    exit then resort to the <code class="computeroutput1">SIGKILL</code>.
    As a matter of convention, most programs will install a handler
    for <code class="computeroutput1">SIGHUP</code> (hangup -- a left over
    from days of serial terminals and modems) which will reload the
    program, perhaps to pick up changes in a configuration file or
    similar.</p><p class="releaseinfo">If you have programmed on a Unix system you would be
    familiar with <code class="computeroutput1">segmentation faults</code>
    when you try to read or write to memory that has not been
    allocated to you.  When the kernel notices that you are touching
    memory outside your allocation, it will send you the segmentation
    fault signal.  Usually the process will not have a handler
    installed for this, and so the default action to terminate the
    program ensues (hence your program "crashes").  In some cases a
    program may install a handler for segmentation faults, although
    reasons for doing this are limited.</p><p class="releaseinfo">This raises the question of what happens after the signal is
    received.  Once the signal handler has finished running, control
    is returned to the process which continues on from where it left
    off.</p><section id="signals_s1"><header class="calibre8"><h3 class="calibre2"><span class="first-last">8<span class="first-last">.</span>1<span class="first-last"> </span></span>Example</h3></header><p class="releaseinfo">The following simple program introduces a lot of signals

      the <code class="computeroutput1">SIGINT</code> signal, which is
      sent when the user presses
      <code class="computeroutput1">ctrl-c</code>.  All the signals for
      the system are defined in
      <code class="computeroutput1">signal.h</code>, including the
      <code class="computeroutput1">signal</code> function which allows us
      to register the handling function.</p><p class="releaseinfo">The program simply sits in a tight loop doing nothing
      until it quits.  When we start the program, we try pressing
      <code class="computeroutput1">ctrl-c</code> to make it quit.  Rather
      than taking the default action, or handler is invoked and we get
      the output as expected.</p><p class="releaseinfo">We then press <code class="computeroutput1">ctrl-z</code>
      which sends a <code class="computeroutput1">SIGSTOP</code> which by
      default puts the process to sleep.  This means it is not put in
      the queue for the scheduler to run and is thus dormant in the
      system.</p><p class="releaseinfo">As an illustration, we use the
      <span>kill</span> program to send the same signal
      from another terminal window.  This is actually implemented with
      the <code class="computeroutput1">kill</code> system call, which
      takes a signal and PID to send to (this function is a little
      misnamed because not all signals do actually kill the process,
      as we are seeing, but the
      <code class="computeroutput1">signal</code> function was already
      taken to register the handler).  As the process is stopped, the
      signal gets <em class="calibre5">queued</em> for the process.  This
      means the kernel takes note of the signal and will deliver it
      when appropriate.</p><p class="releaseinfo">At this point we wake the process up by using the command
      <code class="computeroutput1">fg</code>.  This actually sends a
      <code class="computeroutput1">SIGCONT</code> signal to the process,
      which by default will wake the process back up.  The kernel
      knows to put the process on the run queue and give it CPU time
      again.  We see at this point the queued signal is
      delivered.</p><p class="releaseinfo">In desperation to get rid of the program, we finally try
      <code class="computeroutput1">ctrl-\</code> which sends a
      <code class="computeroutput1">SIGQUIT</code> (abort) to the process.
      But if the process has aborted, where did the
      <code class="computeroutput1">Quit</code> output come from?</p><p class="releaseinfo">You guessed it, more signals!  When a parent child has a
      process that dies, it gets a
      <code class="computeroutput1">SIGCHLD</code> signal back.  In this
      case the shell was the parent process and so it got the signal.
      Remember how we have the zombie process that needs to be reaped
      with the <code class="computeroutput1">wait</code> call to get the
      return code from the child process?  Well another thing it also
      gives the parent is the signal number that the child may have
      died from.  Thus the shell knows that child process died from a
      <code class="computeroutput1">SIGABRT</code> and as an informational
      service prints as much for the user (the same process happens to
      print out "Segmentation Fault" when the child process dies from a
      <code class="computeroutput1">SIGSEGV</code>).</p><p class="releaseinfo">You can see how in even a simple program, around 5
      different signals were used to communicate between processes and
      the kernel and keep things running.  There are many other
      signals, but these are certainly amongst the most common.  Most
      have system functions defined by the kernel, but there are a few
      signals reserved for users to use for their own purposes within
      their programs (<code class="computeroutput1">SIGUSR</code>).</p></section></section></div><div id="chapter05" class="author"><header class="calibre6"><div class="calibre10" id="calibre_pb_34"/>
