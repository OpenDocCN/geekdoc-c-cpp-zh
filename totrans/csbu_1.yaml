- en: Binary is a base-2 number system that uses two mutually exclusive states to
    represent information. A binary number is made up of elements called *bits* where
    each bit can be in one of the two possible states. Generally, we represent them
    with the numerals `1` and `0`. We also talk about them being true and false. Electrically,
    the two states might be represented by high and low voltages or some form of switch
    turned on or off.

- en: You may be wondering how a simple number is the basis of all the amazing things
    a computer can do. Believe it or not, it is! The processor in your computer has
    a complex but ultimately limited set of *instructions* it can perform on values
    such as addition, multiplication, etc. Essentially, each of these instructions
    is assigned a number so that an entire program (add this to that, multiply by
    that, divide by this and so on) can be represented by a just a stream of numbers.
    For example, if the processor knows operation `2` is addition, then `252` could
    mean "add 5 and 2 and store the output somewhere". The reality is of course much
    more complicated (see [Chapter 3, Computer Architecture](csbu-print_split_009.html#chapter02))
    but, in a nutshell, this is what a computer is.

    that make up the program stream by looking at the holes present on the card. Of
    course this moved to being stored via the polarity of small magnetic particles
    rather quickly (tapes, disks) and onto the point today that we can carry unimaginable
    amounts of data in our pocket.

- en: Translating these numbers to something useful to humans is what makes a computer
    so useful. For example, screens are made up of millions of discrete *pixels*,
    each too small for the human eye to distinguish but combining to make a complete
    image. Generally each pixel has a certain red, green and blue component that makes
    up its display color. Of course, these values can be represented by numbers, which
    of course can be represented by binary! Thus any image can be broken up into millions
    of individual dots, each dot represented by a *tuple* of three values representing
    the red, green and blue values for the pixel. Thus given a long string of such
    numbers, formatted correctly, the video hardware in your computer can convert
    those numbers to electrical signals to turn on and off individual pixels and hence
    display an image.

    which can be converted to binary and operated on by the computer. For example,
    to represent all the letters of the alphabet we would need at least enough different
    combinations to represent all the lower case letters, the upper case letters,
    numbers and punctuation, plus a few extras. Adding this up means we need probably
    around 80 different combinations.

    arbitrarily make up a mapping between characters and numbers. For example, a video
    card manufacturer could decide that `1` represents `A`, so when value `1` is sent
    to the video card it displays a capital 'A' on the screen. A printer manufacturer
    might decide for some obscure reason that `1` represented a lower-case 'z', meaning
    that complex conversions would be required to display and print the same thing.

    a way to talk about large numbers of bytes, and a natural way is to use the "International
    System of Units" (SI) prefixes as used in most other scientific areas. So for
    example, kilo refers to 10³ or 1000 units, as in a kilogram has 1000 grams.

    — (`10000000000` — and happens to be quite close to the base 10 meaning value
    of "kilo" (1000 as opposed to 1024). Thus 1024 bytes naturally became known as
    a *kilobyte*. The next SI unit is "mega" for `10⁶` and the prefixes continue upwards
    by 10³ (corresponding to the usual grouping of three digits when writing large
    numbers). As it happens, `2^(20)` is again close to the SI base 10 definition
    for mega; 1048576 as opposed to 1000000\. Increasing the base 2 units by powers
    of 10 remains functionally close to the SI base 10 value, although each increasing
    factor diverges slightly further from the base SI meaning. Thus the SI base-10
    units are "close enough" and have become the commonly used for base 2 values.

    correlate the relationship between number-of-bits and "human" sizes. For example,

    of memory by noting that `2^(32)` can recombine to `2^((2 + 30))` or `2² × 2^(30)`,
    which is just `4 × 2^(30)`, where we know `2^(30)` is a gigabyte. A 64-bit value
    could similarly address up to 16 exabytes (`2⁴ × 2^(60)`); you might be interested
    in working out just how big a number this is. To get a feel for how big that number

    memory and the number of bits used by a computer (occasionally you will also see
    base 8 used, for example for file permissions under UNIX). We simply represent
    larger numbers of bits with more numerals. For example, a sixteen bit variable
    can be represented by `0xAB12`, and to find it in binary simply take each individual
    numeral, convert it as per the table and join them all together (so `0xAB12` ends
    up as the 16-bit binary number `1010101100010010`). We can use the reverse to

    say, 16 possible states it can be represented by 4 bits (i.e. 2⁴=16 unique values).

    waste four bits, or find some way to use those left over bits.

    values "inside" a single 8-bit character. We consider the upper four-bits as one
    value (blue) and the lower 4-bits (red) as another. To extract the lower four
    bits, we set our mask to have the lower-4 bits set to `1` (`0x0F`). Since the
    `logical and` operation will only set the bit if *both* bits are `1`, those bits
    of the mask set to `0` effectively hide the bits we are not interested in.

    this as a unique 4-bit value `1010` (`0x0A`). To get the bits into the right position

    through a number of different states but may only be in one at a time. Say it

    and its associated system libraries in common use is written in C, and every system
    provides a C compiler. To stop the language diverging across each of these systems
    where each would be sure to make numerous incompatible changes, a strict standard
    has been written for the language.
  prefs: []

    referred to by its shortened name *C99*. The standard is maintained by the International
    Standards Organisation (ISO) and the full standard is available for purchase online.
    Older standards versions such as C89 (the predecessor to C99 released in 1989)
    and ANSI C are no longer in common usage and are encompassed within the latest
    standard. The standard documentation is very technical, and details most every
    part of the language. For example it explains the syntax (in Backus Naur form),
    standard `#define` values and how operations should behave.
  prefs: []

    the standard needs to be appropriate for every architecture, both present and
    future. Consequently it takes care *not* to define areas that are architecture
    dependent. The "glue" between the C standard and the underlying architecture is
    the Application Binary Interface (or ABI) which we discuss below. In several places
    the standard will mention that a particular operation or construct has an unspecified
    or implementation dependent result. Obviously the programmer can not depend on
    these outcomes if they are to write portable code.

    low level code and are much more common in the system programming field; the most

    either model. Consider that if the size of `int` is increased to 64 bits you leave
    programmers no way to obtain a 32 bit variable. The only possibly is redefining
    `shorts` to be a larger 32 bit type.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A 64 bit variable is so large that it is not generally required to represent
    many variables. For example, loops very rarely repeat more times than would fit
    in a 32 bit variable (4294967296 times!). Images usually are usually represented
    with 8 bits for each of a red, green and blue value and an extra 8 bits for extra
    (alpha channel) information; a total of 32 bits. Consequently for many cases,
    using a 64 bit variable will be wasting at least the top 32 bits (if not more).
    Not only this, but the size of an integer array has now doubled too. This means
    programs take up more system memory (and thus more cache; discussed in detail
    in [Chapter 3, Computer Architecture](#chapter02)) for no real improvement. For
    the same reason Windows elected to keep their long values as 32 bits; since much
    of the Windows API was originally written to use long variables on a 32 bit system
    and hence does not require the extra bits this saves considerable wasted space
    in the system without having to re-write all the API.
  prefs: []

    32 bit variable; programmers working on a 64 bit system could use it for variables
    they know are bounded to smaller values. However, when moving back to a 32 bit
    system their same `short` variable would now be only 16 bits long, a value which
    is much more realistically overflowed (65536).

    `const` means that a variable will never be modified from its original value and

    execution flow so the compiler must be careful not to re-order access to it in
    any way.

    very confusing very quickly. To help, it provides a series of special types which
    can specify the exact properties of a variable. These are defined in `<stdint.h>`
    and have the form `qtypes_t` where `q` is a qualifier, `type` is the base type,
    `s` is the width in bits and `_t` is an extension so you know you are using the
    C99 defined types.

    sizes. Again see the standard or pull apart the headers for full information.

    we see an example of how types place restrictions on what operations are valid
    for a variable, and how the compiler can use this information to warn when variables
    are used in an incorrect fashion. In this code, we firstly assign an integer value
    into a `char` variable. Since the `char` variable is smaller, we loose the correct
    value of the integer. Further down, we attempt to assign a pointer to a `char`
    to memory we designated as an `integer`. This operation can be done; but it is
    not safe. The first example is run on a 32-bit Pentium machine, and the correct
    value is returned. However, as shown in the second example, on a 64-bit Itanium
    machine a pointer is 64 bits (8 bytes) long, but an integer is only 4 bytes long.
    Clearly, 8 bytes can not fit into 4! We can attempt to "fool" the compiler by
    *casting* the value before assigning it; note that in this case we have shot ourselves
    in the foot by doing this cast and ignoring the compiler warning since the smaller
    variable can not hold all the information from the pointer and we end up with
    an invalid address.

    sign bit representation we could represent -127 thru 127 but with two's complement
    we can represent -127 thru 128\. This is because we have removed the problem of
    having two zeros; consider that "negative zero" is `(~00000000 +1)=(11111111+1)=00000000`
    (note discarded carry bit).

    In base 10, each digit after the decimal place increases the precision of our
    number by 10 times. For example, we can represent `0.0` through `0.9` (10 values)
    with one digit of decimal place, `0.00` through `0.99` (100 values) with two digits,
    and so on. In binary, rather than each additional digit giving us 10 times the
    precision, we only get two times the precision, as illustrated in the table below.
    This means that our binary representation does not always map in a straight-forward
    manner to a decimal representation.

    However, since the range of possible numbers is infinite we will never have enough
    bits to represent *any* possible value.
  prefs: []

    value `0.3` we can only say that it is closest to `0.25`; obviously this is insufficient
    for most any application. With 22 bits of significand we have a much finer resolution,
    but it is still not enough for most applications. A `double` value increases the
    number of significand bits to 52 (it also increases the range of exponent values
    too). Some hardware has an 84-bit float, with a full 64 bits of significand. 64
    bits allows a tremendous precision and should be suitable for all but the most
    demanding of applications (XXX is this sufficient to represent a length to less
    than the size of an atom?)

    places of precision given by `printf` both answers are the same, since they are

    in this case 20 decimal places, we can see the results start to diverge. The code
    using `doubles` has a more accurate result, but it is still not *exactly* correct.

    version as the one where `1/radix <= significand < 1`. In binary this ensures
    that the leftmost bit of the significand is *always one*. Knowing this, we can
    gain an extra bit of precision by having the standard say that the leftmost bit
    being one is implied.

    bit is a `1` and either terminate or repeat. This is a slow process; if the bitfield
    is 64 bits long and only the very last bit is set, you must go through all the
    preceding 63 bits!

    and we were to normalise it, the value of the exponent would tell us how many
    times it was shifted. The process of normalising a number is generally built into
    the floating point hardware unit on the processor, so operates very fast; usually
    much faster than the repeated shift and check operations.

    on an Itanium processor. The Itanium, like most server processors, has support

    means a `unsigned long` neatly fits into the significand of a `long double`. When
    the value is loaded it is normalised, and and thus by reading the exponent value
    (minus the 16 bit bias) we can see how far it was shifted.
