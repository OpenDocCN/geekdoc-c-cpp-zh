- en: Some uses of `nullptr` in C++ don't arise in the first place in Rust because
    of other language differences. For example, [moved objects don't leave anything
    behind that needs to be destroyed](./null/moved_members.html). Therefore there
    is no need to use `nullptr` as a placeholder for a moved pointer that can have
    `delete` or `free` called on it.

- en: Other uses are replaced by `Option`, which in safe Rust requires checking for
    the empty case before accessing the contained value. This use is common enough
    that [Rust has an optimization](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/index.html#representation)
    for when `Option` is used with a reference (`&` or `&mut ref`), `Box` (equivalent
    of `unique_ptr`), and `NonNull` (a non-null raw pointer).
